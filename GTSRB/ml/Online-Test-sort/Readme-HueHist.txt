Pre-computed features: Histogram of hue values

**********************************************

This archive contains the same elements than the official online competition test set. However, the directory and file name scheme 
is the same as the training set.

Histogram of hue values (from the HSV color space) for each single image.
Images were not scaled, but a fixed border of 5 pixels was ignored 
for computation of histograms. Note that we used 0 <= hue <= 255.
Therefore, the resulting feature vector dimensionality is 256.
